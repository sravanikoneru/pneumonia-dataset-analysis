# pneumonia-dataset-analysis
The data set consists of chest x-rays images. Our aim is to predict if the patient has pneumonia from using analysis from the chest X-rays. The infected patientâ€™s lung will be infected in one or both the lungs. So, the X-rays helps in figuring out if the patient has pneumonia or not.choose an algorithm which automatically predicts if the patient has pneumonia or not from the X-rays provided and later categorize him into the causes for the disease
